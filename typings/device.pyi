"""The ``device`` module contains functions to get general information about
any devices plugged into the hub (motors, sensors, displays, etc). 

To use the ``device`` module, add the following import statement to your
project:

::

    import device

All functions in the module should be called inside the ``device``
module as a prefix like so:

::

    device.id(port.A)
